Garage Door Monitor
===========

This project is a Garage door monitor and control.  It was written for the ESP8266 (Specifically the Sparkfun Thing, but should work on other ESP8266).
The source code is for Arduino on ESP8266.

Also included are some schematics:
DoorInputBufferFET.Sch - 5 Spice Analysis Schematic.  This is the schematic I ended up using that worked quite well for me.
